gEDA_Symbols
============

The collection of custom gEDA symbols for Schematic Editor.



NOTE: A gafrc file must be placed in the project directory for Schematic Editor to see these symbols (or modify the gafrc file located in ~/.gEDA). You do not need to be root for this to work.

Add the line: (component-library "${HOME}/gEDA_Component_Library")
Where ~/gEDA_Component_Library is the location of the gEDA symbols.
